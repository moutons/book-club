## About devops

I've been involved in the devops community since 2009 (thanks to devopsdays Austin and various communities on irc), so I was there back when the practitioners who came up with it were defining it initially. I've seen marketing departments come up with product-based descriptions of devops. I was one of the people saying "devops isn't a job!" and then got "DevOps Engineer" as a job title. Many folks have their own definition, mine is something close to what [Boyd Hemphill came up with prior to the 2015 DevOps Enterprise Summit](https://twitter.com/behemphi/status/616321184863551488): 

I'll paraphrase and expand on Boyd's tweet like so:

DevOps is a set of practices and philosophies used by technology organizations, used to improve the business and the community of its practitioners.
These practices and philosophies involve [culture](#culture) improvements, the use of [lean principles](#lean), the use of [automation](#automation), an understanding of effective [measurement](#measurement), and [sharing](#sharing).

### Culture

To understand what's meant by the culture part of the devops foundation, it helps to understand that devops came about from a recognition that in 2007, software developers and the sysadmins who were operating the products they delivered were often very strongly separated within a business (this is not to say that this situation is not still the case, just that it was overwhelmingly the norm at the time). This was also true of salespeople and the software developers (hence sales selling products that don't actually do what they say it does), of sysadmins and database administrators, etc. Andrew Clay Shafer's image of the Wall of Confusion was very popular in early days to demonstrate this strong separation. Unfortunately, the "Dev" and "Ops" in the name gets too much focus - even back in the very early days folks were trying to figure out how to bridge silos across all aspects of the business, not just between Dev and Ops. Dev*Ops was always unnecessary, security and data and ML and the rest were always included (if you ask any of us talking about devops back in the early days, anyway).

### Lean

There's a vast amount of information out there on Lean business practices (in the Toyota/Deming tradition) as they apply to technology organizations. At their core, Lean practices are about a way to deliver greater benefit to society while reducing waste. In my view, organizations which neglect the foundation of Lean practices as providing primary value to society are potentially causing harm by focusing on providing good to a subset of society (e.g., the business first and society later). This may be considered controversial, but there is a strong tradition in non-IT engineering practices of being responsible to society at large, and I believe it is important to bring this into IT engineering practices.
