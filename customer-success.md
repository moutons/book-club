# Customer Success

The field of Customer Success is fairly young. This is a role within software companies which tasks folks with managing long-term relationships between their employer, the vendor, and a set of customers. Folks working in this role will benefit from an understanding of most aspects of their employer's software, the details of their customers' businesses, etc. I'd tend to say that you'd want to understand "devops" philosophy of how to work, but that's predicated on an Boyd Hemphill's [definition of devops](https://twitter.com/behemphi/status/616321184863551488) as the way 


 and the methodologies and philosophy that have arisen out of that community of practice.

[Customer Success](https://www.gainsight.com/book/) is a foundational text in this practice.
