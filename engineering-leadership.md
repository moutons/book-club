# Engineering Leadership

## About

I know somewhat less about engineering management due to not having worked as an engineering manager, but I enjoy reading about it. As for being a leader within engineering organizations as an individual contributor, I suppose you'd have to ask my current and former coworkers but again I've read quite a bit. I like to think that I have done a reasonable job of keeping up with emerging standards of practice and learning how to speak up when it counts and how to empower other ICs to do more fulfilling work.

## Links

Just a selection of links from folks who have inspired me over the years. If I've included more material from one of these folks than others, that doesn't mean they've influenced me more or that I think those posts are more worthwhile, just that they came to mind when I first built this list or that when reading them I thought to add a link here. 

[On Being a Senior Engineer](https://www.kitchensoap.com/2012/10/25/on-being-a-senior-engineer/), John Allspaw
- note: Not the only thing Allspaw has written which is useful to anyone interested in leadership, but you probably already know that, reader.

[People can read their manager's mind](http://yosefk.com/blog/people-can-read-their-managers-mind.html), Yossi Kreinin
- note: I include this mostly because it echoes a belief I hold about power within organizations, applied Conway's Law, and how it is likely impossible to achieve significant organizational change without sustained interest and buy-in from senior leadership. Confirmation bias is great.

[Posts on leadership](https://katemats.com/leadership/), Kate Matsudaira
- note: Kate Matsudaira is someone I don't often hear people talk about when discussing people they read to learn about leadership, which I think is a situation in need of correction. Excellent writing, well worth revisiting Kate's content periodically to refresh and seek new understanding.
